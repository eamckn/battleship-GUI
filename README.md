# Battleship GUI Project

## About
- The goal of this project was to practice approaching a project with TDD, using unit testing and Jest. By focusing on making sure our unit tests for our classes/factories pass before we dive into the game drivers or the UI, we help mitigate the need for any debugging of our most foundational program elements.

## Todo
- Add random computer Ship placement
- Add functionality to rotate ships
  - Adjust computer AI to accomodate ship verticality
  - Adjust how the player gameboard classes log vertical placement
- Add game restart functionality
- Add CSS transitions/animations
- Add 2-player functionality
